Heyyyy,

I hope you are doing well.

Steps for starting the project:

1. Cloning the project on your device
2. Opening it with the Visual Studio 2019

Click "Debug" on your top-bar in Visual Studio and than "Start without debuging".

The project will be opened in your browser.

That is all you need to start my project.

I hope you will enjoy in using my project. 
Abedin
